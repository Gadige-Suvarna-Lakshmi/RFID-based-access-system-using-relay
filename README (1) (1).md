## Overall Learning 
During my internship , I worked with Arduino and ESP32, learning hardware interfacing, sensor integration, and communication protocols. I also learned bare-metal programming, which helped me understand microcontroller architecture, registers, and low-level control without using libraries. This internship strengthened my practical skills, problem-solving ability, and understanding of real-time embedded applications
